# CHLFS Intervention System Dynamics Model

System dynamics simulation of the CHL intervention is a research model where the primary purpose is to be able to identify a plausible feedback explanation for the success of the CHL intervention. 

## Background

Numerous studies have shown population level change from community interventions on childhood obesity, but not through individual within person change. 
E.g., Shape Up Somerville, Romp and Chomp, and the Children's Healthy Living (CHL) study. However, post-hoc analyses have pointed system level effects as a possible explanation, e.g., spillover effects that the family or community level. The NIH COMPACT study sought to explain results from Shape Up Somerville and Romp and Chomp using a combination of group model building and agent-based simulation model of knowledge and engagement. However, results primarily focused on replicating a social network survey, not the prior interventions. 

CHL intervention represents a unique opportunity to get at the unanswered question about system level feedback effects as a possible explanation for population level changes. More specifically, in developiung a system dynamics model of the CHLFS Intervention, we aim to identify the underlying feedback system that can explain the health eating and overweight/obesity trends of children in the intervention and control groups.
